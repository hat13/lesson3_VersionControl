            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a one main repository for all of the project files. It allows team members to check files out, make changes, and then check them back in.  Mainly it is to keeping a software system completely organized when working on different projects with other people.  These changes that are made throughout working on a project as a team are recorded to help benefit the rest of the group. In my experience, using software source code with version control has been significant in helping my team work on a project all together. Using version control will help solve the file sharing problem as well.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system or otherwise known as a VCS has many responsibilities in order to function in the way the user desires.  It is actually pretty interesting in the way the system automatically makes notes of specific changes. A version control system automatically notes who changed the files, it provides a revision history, when the files themselves were changed, what about them was new or different than before, and then finally when a merge changes them to the same file. Benefits of using a version control system are great! Files cannot be overwritten because there is a common repository that holds all the latest files. People can also work simultaneously on the same file without conflict and allows you to revert back to an older version of the file or project if needed! </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within a versioning control systems also known as a VCS, there are repositories. Repositories are another benefit of using version control systems. When a repository is created with files and directories, developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and version, this is called repository to control history. There are also repositories that are remote and local. A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members whereas a local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user.  Creating a local repository can be done in two different ways. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects.  So far with my experience using Git it has been easy to learn.  I have enjoyed using Git because it has allowed me to combine my knowledge of coding with my knowledge of terminal. Because of Git using staging areas and multiple workflows, it has allowed me to stay organized and really emerge myself into a project. Git is a form of a version control system, and it being my first kind of version control system I am excited to see what more advanced version control systems can provide in the future. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Why use Git as a distributed version control system? As a beginner user of Git, I have loved using this software to work on my projects. Every person who uses Git has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine, and because everything is stored locally, you can work offline.  Git does not have a single point of failure, which is extremely beneficial when working on different projects, and processes run much faster than some of the other version control systems. Git also will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. Git also has its own set of commands which makes things easier when working inside terminal.  </p>
